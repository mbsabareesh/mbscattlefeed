            <p>The economic boom in our country has brought about a silent revolution in the form of increased per capita nutrition consumption among the Indian population. A significant contributor to this upward trend in nutrition is the availability of animal protein and dairy products. As a result, there is a growing public demand for high-quality meat, eggs, and milk, presenting a significant challenge to meet this demand. The responsibility of providing quality, wholesome food lies heavily on the shoulders of our dairy and poultry farmers.</p>
